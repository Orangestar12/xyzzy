# This is an example story file. The syntax for a story is this:
#
# path/to/story/file.ext : Name of Story
#
# This follows the usual Unix file selection conventions, which means that to
# select a file relative to the current path, you would do "./folder/file.ext"
# and to select a file relative to the root (an absolute file path), you would
# do "/folder/file.ext"
